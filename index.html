<p style="color:tomato";> August 8 was International Cat Day. Cora probably started the morning like she does any other: by climbing on my chest and pawing at my shoulder,
     demanding attention. I likely sleepily lifted up the comforter and she snuggled underneath it, sprawled at my side. For Cora — and thus for me — every day is International Cat Day.

    Cats may wake us up at 4a.m. and barf at an alarming frequency, yet anywhere between 10 to 30 percent of us call ourselves “cat people” — not dog people,
     not even equal-opportunity cat and dog lovers. So why do we choose to bring these fluffballs into our homes — and spend over $1,000 per year on one who isn’t genetically
      related to us and frankly seems ungrateful most of the time?
    
    The answer is obvious to me — and probably to all cat lovers out there, who need no scientific research to justify their fierce love. But scientists have studied it anyway
     and found that, while our feline friends may not be good for our furniture, they might make some contribution to our physical and mental health.</p>
